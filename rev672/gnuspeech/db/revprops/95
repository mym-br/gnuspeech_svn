Ported all existing applications (Monet, PrEditor, PreMo) and frameworks (GnuSpech.framework, Tube.framework) to run and compile on OS X 10.5 using Xcode 3.1.1. PrEditor requires the 10.4 SDK due to libraries that have become deprecated in 10.5. Also, the pre-monet text-to-phone application has been changed from the name GnuSpeech to PreMo which more aptly describes it's function.
