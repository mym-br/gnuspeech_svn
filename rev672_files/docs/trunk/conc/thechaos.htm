Charivarius, (G.N. Trenite: 1870—1946).
</P>


Dearest creature in creation,<BR>
Studying English pronunciation,<BR>
I will teach you in my verse<BR>
Sounds like corpse, corps, horse and worse.<BR>
It will keep you, Susy, busy,<BR>
Make your head with heat grow dizzy;<BR>
Tear in eye your dress you'll tear.<BR>
So shall I!  Oh hear my prayer:<BR>
Pray console your loving poet,<BR>
Make my coat look new, dear, sew it.<BR>
Just compare heart, beard and heard,<BR>
Dies and diet, Lord and word.<BR>
Sword and sward, retain and Britain,<BR>
(Mind the latter, how it's written).<BR>
Made has not the sound of bade,<BR>
Say—said, pay—paid, laid, but plaid.<BR>
Now I surely will not plague you<BR>
With such words as vague and ague,<BR>
But be careful how you speak:<BR>
Say break, steak, but bleak and streak,<BR>
Previous, precious; fuschia, via;<BR>
Pipe, shipe, recipe and choir;<BR>
Cloven, oven; how and low;<BR>
Script, receipt; shoe, poem, toe.<BR>
Hear me say, devoid of trickery;<BR>
Daughter, laughter and Terpsichore;<BR>
Typhoid, measles, topsails, aisles;<BR>
Exiles, similes, reviles;<BR>
Wholly, holly; signal, signing;<BR>
Thames, examining, combining;<BR>
Scholar, vicar and cigar,<BR>
Solar, mica, war, and far.<BR>
Desire—desirable, admirable—admire;<BR>
Lumber, plumber; bier but brier;<BR>
Chatham, brougham; renown but known,<BR>
Knowledge; done, but gone and tone,<BR>
One, anemone; Balmoral,<BR>
Kitchen, lichen; laundry, laurel;<BR>
Gertrude, German; wind and mind;<BR>
Scene, Melpomene, mankind;<BR>
Tortoise, turquoise, chamois-leather.<BR>
This phonetic labyrinth<BR>
Gives moss, gross; brook, brooch; ninth, plinth.<BR>
Billet does not end like ballet;<BR>
Bouquet, wallet, mallet, chalet;<BR>
Blood and flood are not like food,<BR>
Nor is mould like should and would.<BR>
Banquet is not nearly parquet,<BR>
Which is said to rime with darky.<BR>
Viscous, viscount; load and broad;<BR>
Toward, to forward, to reward.<BR>
And your pronunciation's O.K.<BR>
When you say correctly; croquet;<BR>
Rounded, wounded; grieve and sieve;<BR>
Friend and fiend, alive and live,<BR>
Liberty, library; heave and heaven;<BR>
Rachel, ache, moustache; eleven.<BR>
We say hallowed, but allowed;<BR>
People, leopard; towed, but vowed.<BR>
Mark the difference moreover<BR>
Between mover, plover, Dover;<BR>
Leeches, breeches; wise, precise;<BR>
Chalice, but police and lice.<BR>
Camel, constable, unstable,<BR>
Principle, discipline, label;<BR>
Petal, penal and canal;<BR>
Wait, surmise, plait, promise; pal.<BR>
Suit, suite, ruin; circuit, conduit,<BR>
Rime with: "shirk it" and "beyond it";<BR>
But it is not hard to tell<BR>
Why it's pall, mall, but PallMall.<BR>
Muscle, muscular; goal and iron;<BR>
Timber, climber; bullion and lion;<BR>
Worm and storm; chaise, chaos, chair;<BR>
Senator, spectator, mayor.<BR>
Ivy, privy; famous; clamour,<BR>
And enamour rime with "hammer".<BR>
Pussy, hussy and possess,<BR>
Desert, but dessert, address.<BR>
Golf, wolf; countenants; lieutenants<BR>
Hoist, in lieu of flags, left pennants.<BR>
River, rival; tomb, bomb, comb;<BR>
Doll and roll, and some and home.<BR>
Stranger does not rime with anger,<BR>
Neither does devour with clangour.<BR>
Soul, but foul; and gaunt, but aunt;<BR>
Font, front, won't; want, grand and grant;<BR>
Shoes, goes, does.  Now first say finger,<BR>
And then; singer, ginger, linger.<BR>
Real, zeal; mauve, gauze and gauge;<BR>
Marriage, foliage, mirage, age.<BR>
Query does not rime with very,<BR>
Nor does fury sound like bury.<BR>
Dost, lost, post; and doth, cloth, loth;<BR>
Job, Job; blossom, bosom, oath.<BR>
Though the difference seems little<BR>
We say actual, but victual;<BR>
Seat, sweat; chaste, caste; Leigh, eight, height;<BR>
Put, nut; granite but unite.<BR>
Reefer does not rime with deafer,<BR>
Feoffer does, and zephyr, heifer.<BR>
Dull, bull; Geoffrey, George; ate, late;<BR>
Hint, pint; senate, but sedate.<BR>
Scenic, Arabic, Pacific;<BR>
Science, conscience, scientific.<BR>
Tour, but our, and succour, four;<BR>
Gas, alas and Arkansas!<BR>
Sea, idea, guinea, area,<BR>
Psalm, Maria, but malaria.<BR>
Youth, south, southern; cleanse and clean;<BR>
Doctrine, turpentine, marine.<BR>
Compare alien with Italian.<BR>
Dandelion with battalion,<BR>
Sally with ally, Yea, Ye,<BR>
Eye, I, ay, aye, whey, key, quay.<BR>
Say aver, but ever, fever,<BR>
Neither, leisure, skein, receiver.<BR>
Never guess—it is not safe;<BR>
We say calves, valves; half, but Ralf.<BR>
Heron, granary, canary;<BR>
Crevice and device and eyrie;<BR>
Face, preface, but efface,<BR>
Phlegm, phlegmatic; ass, glass, bass;<BR>
Large, but target, gin, give, verging;<BR>
Ought, out, joust and scour, but scourging;<BR>
Ear, but earn; and wear and tear<BR>
Do not rime with "here" but "ere".<BR>
Seven is right, but so is even;<BR>
Hyphen, roughen, nephew, Stephen;<BR>
Monkey, donkey; clerk and jerk;<BR>
Asp, grasp, wasp; and cork and work.<BR>
Pronunciation—think of psyche—<BR>
Is a paling, stout and spikey;<BR>
Won't it make you lose your wits,<BR>
writing groats and saying "groats"?<BR>
It's a dark abyss or tunnel,<BR>
Strewn with stones, like rowlock, gunwale,<BR>
Islington and Isle of Wight,<BR>
Housewife, verdict and indict.<BR>
Don't you think so, reader, rather<BR>
Saying lather, bather, father?<BR>
Finally: which rimes with "enough",<BR>
Though, through, plough, cough, hough or tough?<BR>
Hiccough has the sound of "cup",<BR>
My advice is ... give it up!
