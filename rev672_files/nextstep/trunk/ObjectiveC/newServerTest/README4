This is the 4th version of the client-side of the server. This version
fixes the bug associated with starting up the server (fork bug).  The
problem was with the NXSetDefaultsUser() function:  it was trashing
memory used for NXDefaults set up by the user and by the appkit.  The
problem was solved by putting the function call in the child process,
therefore protecting the defaults memory used in the parent process.
