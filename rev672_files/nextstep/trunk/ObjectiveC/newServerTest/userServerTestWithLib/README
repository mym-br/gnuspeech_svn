This subdirectory contains the source code for the TextToSpeech
ServerTest application.  In many ways this is the simplest interface
to the TextToSpeech Object.  There are only two fields, one for data
entry, and another one in which to return data or error codes.  Each
method is represented by its own button, and almost every method of
the Object is made accessible to the user.

ServerTest is only meant to provide access to all methods of the
TextToSpeech Object in the simplest manner possible.  The interface is
not very elegant, since most of the functions are better controlled with
sliders or buttons---an example of a better user interface can be seen
in the BigMouth application.  However, ServerTest is useful in that it
provides a feel for how the TextToSpeech Object works, and to confirm
the behaviour of its methods.

Note that the speakStream: method normally takes a raw memory stream
as its input.  In the ServerTest, a file name is accepted and mapped
to a memory stream.  This method can be tested by typing in
"streamInputFile".  This file can be edited as desired.
