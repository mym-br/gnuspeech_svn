Hi Craig:

This is the second version of the client-side parts of the server.
I've made all the global variables into instance variables, and changed
the C functions into internal methods.  This solves the scoping problem,
and the problem of no inherited dataspace when subclassing.

Also note that the initiateConnection method (formerly initiate_connection())
expects the value of SpeechIdentifier to be returned to the client using
receive_int_message().  This causes problems now, since I think the server
still uses a simple message.  Make sure that SpeechIdentifier ranges from
0 to 49;  sending a value outside of this range signals that a connection
cannot be made, implying that all the client slots are being used.

I've altered speakText:, serverVersion, pronunciation:::, 
and linePronunciation:: so that they will resend a message to the
server after a restart.  This means that these methods no longer need
to be executed twice to speak or return the appropriate data after a
restart.

Finally, I've fixed the bugs to do with pointers pointing to memory
allocated on the stack.  Simply involved declaring some arrays static.
