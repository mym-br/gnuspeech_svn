TabletKit 1.1 Installation

    To install the TabletKit, you will need to log in as root. If you
don't know the root password for the computer you are using, you will
need to have your system administrator install the TabletKit for you.

   If the TabletKit has previously been installed on your system, or
you are upgrading, uninstall (compress) the previous version using
Installer.app and move it to a safe location for later retrieval in
case the need arises.

NOTE: The licensed and demo distributions of the TabletKit are
identical in all respects, except the demo version does not contain
the libraries necessary for compiling applications utilizing the
TabletKit API.

WARNING: Do not attempt to install 'hppa' or 'sparc' versions of the
TabletKit on NeXT Mach OS release 3.2. The installation requires
rebuilding of TabletKit library table of contents, and ranlib/libtool
in OS release 3.2 cannot handle fat libraries containing 'sparc' and
'hppa' object code.
