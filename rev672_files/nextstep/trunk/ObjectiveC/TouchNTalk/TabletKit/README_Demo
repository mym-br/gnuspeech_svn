TabletKit Description

    The TabletKit defines a high-level framework and API that
facilitates communication between applications and graphics
tablets. Tablet input occurs independent of both the mouse and a
specific display area of the screen. This framework eases development
of applications relying on tablet information for digitizing graphs,
maps, and other images, in addition to free hand drawing, gesture
recognition, and many other activities requiring a tablet and stylus
or cursor as the primary mode of input. The TabletKit fully supports
features common to many tablets including:

	-  Transmission control settings (baud rate, parity, etc.)
	-  Communication protocol settings
	-  Alternate report formats and report frequency
	-  Resolution and orientation settings
	-  Multi-button pressure and angle sensitive stylus
	-  4-button and 16-button cursor

    The TabletKit also provides a high-level API for developers that
allows creation of custom tablet reader bundles for reading data from
tablets with currently unsupported data formats. The TabletKit
currently provides two bundles for reading the MM/SummaSketch and
UIOF/Microgrid binary data formats.
