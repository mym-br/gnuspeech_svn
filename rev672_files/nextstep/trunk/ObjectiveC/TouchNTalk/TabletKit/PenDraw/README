PenDraw

    This application uses the TabletKit to draw in a resizeable view,
providing open/save support for EPS and TIFF images. Information from
the TK_EVENT structure allows us to draw a line segment from the
location of the previous tablet event to that of the current one. The
view is resizable, and is "mapped" to the size of the tablet (assuming
default resolution of 500 lpi). To draw, hold down the primary button
while moving the stylus or cursor. For the SummaSketch III stlyus,
this button is located on the stylus writing tip.

Note: By default, device file /dev/ttyb is used to communicate with
the tablet, which assumes you have your tablet attached to serial port
B. If you have your tablet attached to serial port A then an error
message indicating PenDraw could not connect to the tablet is
displayed in the console and PenDraw will not draw anything. Simply
set the preferences in PenDraw to use /dev/ttya instead of /dev/ttyb.
