/* Returns the shared instance to a TactileSpeaker object. Note that initializing the speechInstance

 * In addition, the -alloc method invoked is actually the one residing in the superclass, but within 
 * our own execution context. Therefore the return type of [super alloc] is infact an instance of the
 * local class! So it seems that super actually acts ONLY as a pointer to where to look for a 
 * particular method, but the instance returned is that of the working class -- that is, an instance 
 * of the current working class context. Here is an explanatory note from Len,
 *
 *     "When you do a [super alloc], I think what is returned is the id of the class in which 
 *      you are working (not the superclass). I say this because the usual way to allocate 
 *      memory for an instance of a class is to do:
 *
 *          self = [super alloc];
 *
 *      Since this is done in the context of the +alloc method, the compiler is smart enough 
 *      to know that you are allocating memory for the class's instance variables plus all 
 *      inherited instance variables."
