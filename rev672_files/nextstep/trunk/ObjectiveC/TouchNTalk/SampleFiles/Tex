NAME
     tex, initex, virtex  - text formatting and typesetting

SYNOPSIS
     tex [ first line ]

     initex [ first line ]

     virtex [ first line ]


DESCRIPTION
     TeX on the NeXT computer system must be installed before its
     first use.  It's available on the _N_e_X_T_S_T_E_P _R_e_l_e_a_s_e _3 CD-ROM,
     in a package named NeXTTeX.

     TeX formats the interspersed text and commands contained in
     the named files and outputs a typesetter independent file
     (called _D_V_I which is short for _De_Vice _Independent).  TeX
     capabilities and language are described in _T_h_e _T_e_X _b_o_o_k by
     Donald E. Knuth, published by Addison-Wesley.  There is also
     an older manual, _T_e_X _a_n_d _M_E_T_A_F_O_N_T, which describes the older
     version of TeX , now called TeX 78, but this description is
     now obsolete.  The present version of TeX	(often refered to
     internally as TeX 82) incorporates literally hundreds of
     changes from this older version.

     Any arguments given on the command line to the TeX programs
     are passed to them as the first input line.  As described in
     _T_h_e _T_e_X _b_o_o_k, that line should begin with a file name or a
     \controlsequence.	The normal usage is to say ``tex _p_a_p_e_r''
     to start processing _p_a_p_e_r._t_e_x. The name ``paper'' will be
     the ``jobname'', and is used in forming output file names.
     If TeX  doesn't get a file name in the first line, the job-
     name is ``texput''.  The default `.tex' extension can be
     overridden by specifying an extension explicitly.

     If there is no paper.tex in the current directory, TeX  will
     look look through a search path of directories to try to
     find it.  The standard library on the default search path
     has the basic format package, plain.tex, described in the
     TeX book, as well as several others.  Note that it is hardly
     ever necessary to \input plain, since the _t_e_x program has
     preloaded it.  This means that all of the control sequences
     discussed in the TeX book are known to TeX .

     The output DVI file is written on _n_a_m_e._d_v_i where _n_a_m_e is the
     jobname.  A log of error messages goes into _n_a_m_e._l_o_g.

     Note that there have been incompatible changes in the DVI
     format between TeX 78 and TeX 82, so programs used to print
     TeX 78 output will not work for TeX 82.  A number of output
     drivers are available.  Ask your local TeX  guru for infor-
     mation on what one you should use.

     There are some environment variables that can be used to set
     up directory paths to search when TeX  opens a file for
     input.  For example, the _c_s_h command
       setenv TEXINPUTS .:/usr/me/mylib:/usr/lib/tex/inputs
     or the _s_h command sequence
	 TEXINPUTS=.:/usr/me/mylib:/usr/lib/tex/inputs
	 export TEXINPUTS
     would cause all invocations of tex and its derivatives to
     look for \input files first in the current directory, then
     in a hypothetical user's ``mylib'', and finally in the sys-
     tem library.  Normally, the user will place the command
     sequence which sets up the TEXINPUTS environment variable in
     the ._c_s_h_r_c or ._p_r_o_f_i_l_e file.  The Environment section below
     lists the relevant environment variables, and their
     defaults.

     The _e response to TeX 's error prompt causes the _v_i editor
     to start up at the current line of the current file.  There
     is an environment variable, TEXEDIT, that can be used to
     change the editor used.  It should contain a string with
     "%s" indicating where the filename goes and "%d" indicating
     where the decimal linenumber (if any) goes.  For example, a
     TEXEDIT string for (Gosling's) _e_m_a_c_s can be set by:
       setenv TEXEDIT "/usr/bin/emacs -l/usr/lib/tex82/tex-start
     -estartline %d %s"
     (replacing the path name for the emacs as appropriate on
     your system).

     A convenient file in the library is null.tex, containing
     nothing.  When tex can't find a file it thinks you want to
     input, it keeps asking you for another file name;	respond-
     ing `null' gets you out of the loop if you don't want to
     input anything.

     Two other TeX  programs, _i_n_i_t_e_x and _v_i_r_t_e_x, can be used to
     create fast-loading customized versions of TeX .  The _i_n_i_t_e_x
     program is used to create a _f_o_r_m_a_t (._f_m_t) file that permits
     fast loading of fonts and macro packages.	After processing
     the fonts and definitions desired, a \dump command will
     create the format file.  The format file is used by _v_i_r_t_e_x.
     It needs to be given a format file name as the first thing
     it reads.	A format file name is preceded by an &, which
     needs to be escaped with \ if given on the command line.
     So, for instance, one could create a file myfmt.fmt using
     initex, and then set up a cshell alias with
       alias mytex "virtex \&myfmt"
     to allow the use of ``mytex paper''.

ENVIRONMENT
     The defaults for all environments are set at the time of
     compilation, by reference to a file called site.h. The
     values given below are preset in this file, and may be dif-
     ferent at some sites.

     TEXINPUTS
	  Search path for \input and \openin files.  It should be
	  colon-separated, and start with ``.''.  The entire path
	  must be no longer than 700 characters long.  Default:
	  .:/usr/lib/tex/inputs

     TEXFONTS
	  Search path for font metric files.  The entire path
	  must be no longer than 100 characters long.  The
	  default doesn't include the current area (".") to avoid
	  confusing the programs that convert the output for
	  printing on the various output devices (most of which
	  don't know about the path stuff yet).  Default:
	  /usr/lib/tex/fonts

     TEXFORMATS
	  Search path for format files.  Default: .:/usr/lib/tex

     TEXPOOL
	  Search path for TeX  strings.  Default: .:/usr/lib/tex

     TEXEDIT
	  Command template for switching to editor. Default:
	  "/usr/bin/emacs +%d %s"

TRIVIA
     TeX , pronounced properly, rhymes with ``blecchhh.''  Note
     that the proper spelling in typewriter-like output is
     ``TeX'' and not ``TEX'' or ``tex.''

BUGS
     Maybe there should be character other than & to specify for-
     mat files, since if you forget the \ on the command line, it
     doesn't do what you want!	Also, there is no way to read a
     TeX  input file with no filename extension.

AUTHORS
     TeX  was designed by Donald E. Knuth, who implemented it
     using his WEB system for Pascal programs.	It was ported to
     Unix at Stanford by Howard Trickey, and at Cornell by Pavel
     Curtis.  This version is a combination of their efforts.
