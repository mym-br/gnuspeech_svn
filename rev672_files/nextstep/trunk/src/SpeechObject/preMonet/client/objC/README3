Hi Craig:

This is the 3rd version of the client-side part of the server.
I've removed all static variables---they cause problems in an
Objective C environment.  SetEscapeCharacter: now also rejects
non-ASCII characters.

Three new methods have been added:

	speakStream:
	setBlock:
	block

The speakStream: method is a cover for the speakText: method,
so no new enumerated messages have been added for it.  However,
2 new messages have been added for the block and setBlock:
methods---you will have to add these to the server.  I've added
the DIAGNOSIS message number to the SpeechMessages.h file as well.
Make sure that blocking happens ONLY with the speakText message
(when asked for), and not with any of the other messages.

The TTS_types.h file has been changed to allow easy setting of the
RANDOMIZE bit for the intonation mask.  The library will now pass
this bit through to the server.

I've also added automatic library making to the Makefile.
Once a "make all" has been done, simply type "make libraries".
Also, you can type "make header" to create a subdirectory of
the needed include files for the libraries. 

You'll notice two additional subdirectories:

	serverTestWithLib
	userServerTestWithLib

The first contains files for compiling the serverTest with the
TextToSpeechPlus library.  The second contains files for compiling
with the plain TextToSpeech library, and is suitable for public
distribution since the references to hidden methods are all deleted.
