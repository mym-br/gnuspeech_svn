Fixed start up code so that client waits somewhat longer before giving
up on the server.

Shortened most message timeouts to 3 seconds.

speakText: and linePronunciation: methods now await an immediate acknowledge
from the server (int message) with a 3 second timeout.  The message from after
the parse stage in the server now has a timeout of 30 seconds.

Added the dictionaryVersion method.
