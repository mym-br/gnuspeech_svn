Hi Geoff.

	Here is list of some of the symbols I will need embedded
into the phoneme list.  Because this is fairly new, please keep the
system open to additions and alterations of symbols.  These symbols 
are similar to the Halliday intonation conventions.

Symbol		Meaning
/_		Foot boundary
//		Tone group boundary
/* 		Beginning of tonic foot
/0		statement
/1		exclaimation
/2		question
/3		continuation

/N		beginning of noun phrase
/n		ending of noun phrase
/V		beginning of verb phrase
/v		ending of verb phrase
/P		beginning of prepositional phrase
/p		ending of prepositional phrase

/t#		word tag and its integer value (#=integer)
/s#		silence and duration in seconds (#=float)

The following are not yet fully defined or are not as important as the
others:

/a		arbitrary pitch movement.  We discussed this as
		"this is a good place to put a non-tonic pitch
		movement."  
/e		marking the beginning of eclitic segments
/r		marking the beginning of proclitic segments (note:
			the 'p' was already in use)

If you have any questions, suggestions or see any gaping holes, please 
let me know (by mail or whatever).
