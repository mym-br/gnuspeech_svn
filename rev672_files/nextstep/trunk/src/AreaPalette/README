This directory contains the source code for creating
AreaPalette.palette, plus the associated installer package.  To create
the palette, click "build" in the builder panel in ProjectBuilder
(the "palette" target should be used).  Alternatively, you can type
"make palette" in a terminal shell.

The make process described above will create the library
"libAreaPalette.a" in the ./lib subdirectory, and will also copy the
include files "Area.h" and "AreaCell.h" into the ./headerFiles
subdirectory.

The RootInstall shell script is used to copy the library, include
files, and palette into appropriate final locations in the file
heirarchy.  These locations are:

	/usr/local/lib/libAreaPalette.a
	/usr/local/include/Area/Area.h
	/usr/local/include/Area/AreaCell.h
	/LocalDeveloper/Palettes/AreaPalette.palette

As the name implies, this script must be run as root.

Once the files are installed in their proper places, an Installer
package can be created by running the MakePackage shell script.  This
script need not be run as root.  It creates the package called
AreaPalette.pkg.  This package can be copied to optical or floppy
disk, for distribution to other computers.  The package must be
installed as root.

To use the AreaPalette, start up InterfaceBuilder and click on the
"Load Palette..." sub-menu item, under the "Tools" main menu item.
Find the file /LocalDeveloper/Palettes/AreaPalette.palette, and click
the OK button.  InterfaceBuilder will then load the palette.

If you incorporate the Area control into your application, be sure to
add the AreaPalette library to your project.  This can be done in
Project Builder by double clicking on the "Libraries" icon in the
Files panel, and choosing the libAreaPalette.a file in /usr/local/lib.
