	* Changed Speech.m to conform to new input standards for the
	TTS Object.  Changed literal mode to raw mode, fixed some
	escape characters, and made sure that raw mode entry was properly
	marked.

	* Version 2.0.1

	====== NO CHANGE HERE SIMPLY A REMINDER TO MYSELF FOR LATTER ======
	* Program will be frozen in rcs. Under the name V2-0-1. The old
	version has been refrozen as V2-0-0. This VX-X-X is just a
	symbolic name, for my benfit. This makes it easier to checkout a
	particular version of the entire program, without having to know
	the version of each individual file in RCS.
	So now to check out V2-0-0 simply do co -rV2-0-0 RCS/* and you
	have it. or to check in everything as V2-0-1 simply do a ci
	-rV2-0-1 *.

	* MyText now also implements flagsDidChange: and the delegate
	method textFlagsDidChange:flags:keyCode: before these messages get
	sent you must add NX_SHIFTMASK to the window's EventMask. This is
	the window where the TextObject is being used.

	    PrEditor now will shift the keyboard either of the shift keys
	    are pressed, or ShiftLock is enabled.  When the keyboard is
	    reenabled the KeyboardController Object will check the state
	    of the AlphaLock key and set the visual display appropriately.

	* The Filter Functions in EnglishText and KeyboardText now check
	the flags if the COMMAND KEY was pressed along with a letter the
	default filterfunciton is called and what ever it returns is
	returned by the custom filter function.  This is done because the
	charCode for Command-D is the same as that for D.

	* Finally got feed up with those stupid TextFieldCells that I
	made. What i have done now is:

	      - Created a subclass of Text called MyText, in the
	      Application new method, get MyText to pose as the standard
	      text object.  MyText implements two new text delegation
	      methods:
	      		- textDidGetKey:textObject charCode: (unsigned short
			int )charCode
			
				This one will send a message to the
				delegate whenever a key is pressed in the
				text object.  charCode containes the
				character code of the key that was pressed.

			- textDidMouseDown:textObject

				When ever a mouse down event occurs in the
				textObject the delegate will be notified
				of the event.
		
		- Added some categories to TextField so that it
		understands the newly added Categories (TextKeys) Category
		defined in TextFieldCat.[hm] 

		- EnglishText.[hm] and KeyboardText.[hm] are now
		subclasses of Object.  They are no longer subclasses of
		TextField. Now they are simply textDelegates of the
		appropriate TextField.  EnglishText is a textDelegate of
		the TextField where the word is entered. KeyboardText is
		the textDelegate of the field where the Pronuncations are
		entered. 

		In both EnglishText and Keyboard text, you will notice an
		instance variable called oldCharFilter which holds the
		original character filter function, although this is
		getting set, it is currently not being used to reset the
		old filter function.  This instance variable oldCharFilter
		is present for future expansion.

	* Small Bug in PrDictViewer Object (PrDictViewer.m file) in the
	method loadDict:

	  Workaround, the method loadColumnZero will only Get called when
	there are no  mainWindows up on the screen, ie dictionary == nil
	when this happens we explicitly get the browser to reload it self.
	What will happen is that the current contents of the browser will
	get completely removed, this is needed because, the browser values
	are set with setStringValueNoCopy, so when the current dictionary
	is removed, so are pointers from the Browser into memory for the
	strings. An alternative fix would be in the method
	browser:loadCell:atRow:inColumn: change the setStringValueNoCopy:
	to setStringValue:

	* A new object has been created called CustomSlider and
	CustomSliderCell. What it does is gives you a slider that is will
	behave like a normal slider while the Knob is being moved (it will
	send continuous messages to the target) until the mouse has lifted
	up (mouseUp event) then a message (only 1) will get send to
	target2.

	This gives a slider that can be both continuous and noncontinuous
	at the sametime.

	* Fixed a bug in PrefMgr.m, where the cursor rects for the
	TextFields didn't get updated properly. That is the Insertion
	Cursor would be visible over top a button.  I forgot to set the
	currentView and as a consequence didn't remove the old view from
	it's subview.  All fixed now. (Change made to PrefMgr.m)

	* This Bug Has been fixed
		Sometimes the Contents Viewer Window pops up but it is
		larger than it should be, if this persits change the calls
		to move and size the panel from sizeWindow:: moveTo:: to
		placeWindow: or placeWindowAndDisplay: 
	What it was, was that i saved the position of the Help window in
	the default value for the Contents Viewer.  (Change made to Help.m)

	* Before the window is displayed now in initFromFile: the
	updateFont method is called in PrEditorDocument.m.  That way the
	keyboard will ALWAYS Be displaying the correct font instead of
	displaying Helvetica for a while until the user makes the current
	window the active window.

	* There was a bug when no entry was found in the defaults database
	for the default font, instead of setting the default font to
	trillium-phonetic it set it to helvetica.  This has been fixed
	now. 
	In InspectorMgr.m
	(const char *)fontName

	* The current Version of PrEditor (frozen in the RCS Files) is
	2.0, as soon as Len and David are finished Alpha Testing it, it
	will get frozen again at version 2.0.1.  My plan is to use the
	last numeral to indicate bug fixes in the current version. the
	first number will indicate major improvements, the second will
	indicate minor improvements (whatever that happens to mean) and
	the last will indicate bug fixes.

	* The program seems stable now, Although Wierd things seem to be
	happening occasionally. Like:

		A word stored in the dictionary without a type (I have put
		some code in the pronunciation() call to help cope with
		this possiblity)

		Sometimes the Contents Viewer Window pops up but it is
		larger than it should be, if this persits change the calls
		to move and size the panel from sizeWindow:: moveTo:: to
		placeWindow: or placeWindowAndDisplay: 

	* The PrDict Object now uses a ChildZone to hold the stuff for the
	valueAtPos: method call.  In the valueAtPos: method in PrDict, i
	don't bother checking if the NXZoneCreate calls can actually
	create a zone, because if they can't, this means that there is no
	memory on the system.  Therefore it isn't even possible to put up
	an error panel notifying the user, so letting the program seg
	fault is okay in this case.

	* All of the NiftyMatrixies in the program, IE the Word Type and
	the Dictionary Order now do not have a disabled scroller along
	side them, it looks much better now.

	* NiftyMatrixCell now uses the textObject already provided to
	display the text, instead of the stuff Jayson Adams did.
	(Actually Jayson on the Net said that the stuff that he did was
	inefficient which is the main reason why i changed it)

	* NiftyMatrix now uses only one copy of the cacheWindows which are
	shared by all instances of the Object.

	* When the user quites the Application without closing all of
	the windows, PrEditor now will close all connections to the
	speech server.  It previously was only doing this when the
	user closed a window.

	* Everything seems to be finished, now.  (to the code anyways) I
	am now considering PrEditor finished. (Ignoring Bug reports, for
	now) 

Fri May  8 18:57:08 1992  Vince DeMarco  (vince@whatnxt.cuc.ab.ca)

	* Extensive changes made to:
		InspectorMgr.[hm]
		PrDictViewer.[hm]
		PrEditorDocument.[hm]
		PrefMgr.[hm]
		Help.[hm]
	Essentually everything.

Tue May  5 13:55:36 1992  Vince DeMarco  (vince@whatnxt.cuc.ab.ca)

	* Added object to list current contents of dictionary file
	(PrDictViewer.nib PrDictViewer.[hm])

Fri May  1 17:59:52 1992  Vince DeMarco  (vince@whatnxt.cuc.ab.ca)

	* More changes to PrEditorDocument.m mainly in validateCommand:
	the menu options under the Edit menu option, will now only be
	activated if a word or pronunciation have been entered in the
	fields (phonField and englishField)
	(Edited PrEditorDocument.m)

	* Made the Help window not "Visible at Launch Time"
	(Edited Help.nib)

Thu Apr 30 17:51:01 1992  Vince DeMarco  (vince@whatnxt.cuc.ab.ca)

	* Made the font size in the pronunciation field 20 pt instead
	(Edited PrEditorDocument.m and Document.nib)

Wed Apr 29 17:33:04 1992  Vince DeMarco  (vince@whatnxt.cuc.ab.ca)

	* Bug fixed in InspectorMgr.m in method
	- (const char *)fontName

Mon Apr  6 19:09:20 1992  Vince DeMarco  (vince@whatnxt.cuc.ab.ca)

	* Program given to Trillium (Finally version frozen in RCS)
