This directory contains the driver code for the Turtle Beach Multisound DSP 
card.

We try to present a uniform interface to all Motorolla DSP56001-based
cards.  However, NEXTSTEP's Driver Kit does not currently allow for
shared abstract superclasses.  (There's some debate about whether it
supports abstract super- classes at all.  Hence, to avoid trouble, I
haven't used one.)  Neither does it allow for user-level Driver Kit
objects.  Therefore, we implement a pseudo-object orientation as
follows:

Any files beginning with the name "dspdriver" are "shared".  That is, no
changes should be made to these files without propogating the changes to 
the other drivers.  No code specific to the Turtle Beach card should be in 
these files.  All code specific to the Turtle Beach card should be in files 
beginning with TurtleBeachMS. 

To make a driver for a new card:

1. Copy the upstairs directory recursively.
2. Change all references to TurtleBeachMS to <YourCard>, including file names.
3. Add your card's special-purpose code.
4. Adjust the Default.table appropriately for your card's requirements.
