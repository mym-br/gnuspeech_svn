This subdirectory contains the source code for the BigMouth
application.  BigMouth provides a service to other applications,
allowing selected text or files to be converted to synthesized speech.
Full control over voice type, vocal tract length offset, pitch offset,
volume, number of channels, balance, speed, and intonation is
conveniently provided in the Preferences Panel. The Scratch Pad allows
users to experiment with text-to-speech conversion of arbitrary text
and files.

Long spoken text may be interrupted with the "pause" item in the main
menu, and resumed with the "continue" menu item.  Spoken text can be
stopped entirely with the "stop" item, and "repeat" will repeat the
last utterance.

BigMouth is fairly complete.  Possible enhancements include setting
the User Dictionary, and support of speakText: modes.  Doubtless,
programmers will find other features to add.

The source code provides clear examples of how to incorporate
text-to-speech into applications using the TextToSpeech Kit.  In
particular, one should note the conventions used when instantiating
and freeing a TextToSpeech object---it is poor practise to terminate
an application before severing the connection to the TTS server (via
-free).
