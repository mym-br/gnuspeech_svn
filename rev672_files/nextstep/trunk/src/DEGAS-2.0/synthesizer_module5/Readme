February 7th, 1992:	Changed convert_to_pitch() so that it can return
			fractional pitch.

January 31st, 1992:	Finished Final DMA version.  Synthesizer is
			reconfigured so that R1-R4 are in order, fricative
			branch is inserted between R3 and R4, amplitude
			modulation is performed on noise, and added a nasal
			branch consisting of a nasal bypass switch, fixed
			nasal resonator (FNR), and nasal notch filter (NNF).

January 17th, 1992:     Finalized the program, reformatting the hack
                        described below for 030s and older 040s.  The
			program now works for ALL NeXT hardware.

October 23, 1991:	Added a hack to provide feedback when testing
			for problems on older 040 hardware.

July 30th, 1991: 	Added a thread_suspend() and thread_resume(),
			so that the synthesizer thread is put to sleep
			when the synthesizer is idle.  This results in
			a very low system load.  However, when the synthesizer
			is running, the system CPU time goes to maximum.
			This is probably due to busy waits on the remaining
			thread_switch()'s.

June 28th, 1991:	Finished version of synthesizer module, ready
			for integration.  The code is fully commented
			and documented.  The synthesizer is fully
			re-entrant, with its own event loop within its
			own thread.  The test program "test_synth"
			displays its capabilities.
