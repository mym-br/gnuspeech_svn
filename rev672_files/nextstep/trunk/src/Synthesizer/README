# Revision 1.9  1994/10/20  22:41:05  len
# Adjusted the output volume upwards, and made 1 channel output the same as

# Changed nose and mouth aperture filter coefficients, so now specified

HISTORY:

October 20th, 1994:	Adjusted the output volume upwards, and made 1 channel
			output the same as stereo output with the balance
			at 0.0.

October 4th, 1994:	Normalized the nose and mouth aperture filter
			coefficients, so now specified in Hz (which scales
			appropriately as the tube length changes), rather
			than an arbitrary coefficient value.

October 3rd, 1994:	Changed some routines which use r3 and r4, to be
			consistent with the same routines in tube_module.

September 26th, 1994:	Moved calculation of crossmix and anti-crossmix values
			to output loop.

September 18th, 1994:	Resectioned the TRM so that it now has 8 regions
			composed of 10 section.  Also has continuous frication
			injection from sections 3 to 10.  

September 13th, 1994:	Folded in optimizations made in synthesizer.asm
			(from the tube_module).  The minimum tube length
			now is about 12.8 cm.   

July 12th, 1994:	Added an option to choose 1 or 2 output channels.
			Also changed the file format to include the number
			of channels and the control rate (not used in the
			interactive synthesizer), plus added a file version
			number to the beginning of the file.  The file
			version number will allow future revisions of the
			application to read old file formats.

June 17th, 1994:	Fixed a bug which caused the sound out to fail
			occasionally in synchronous dma output mode.  Now,
			interactive data is not sent to the DSP while output
			occurs.

May 19th, 1994:		Finished the interactive version of the Tube Resonance
			Model Synthesizer.  Arranged files for archiving into
			CVS.
