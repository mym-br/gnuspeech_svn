There are a lot of files here.  There is source code to all of the
original Nextstep TextToSpeech Kit, demo applications, test
applications and tools, administrative utilities used by Trillium
while the TTS Kit was a commerical product (serial number
generation/verification, encrypted pronunciation dictionaries,
installer tools, etc.)  In some cases there are multiple versions,
such as realtime-Monet versus the Monet editor application, or the
SpeechObject used with the old Degas data versus the new Monet data.

All of this can be confusing, so I've tried to provide descriptions to
the various parts.

From the point of view of porting a complete TextToSpeech Kit to a
modern platform, the most important pieces are:

/gnuspeech/trillium/ObjectiveC/Monet - This is a core component of the
TextToSpeech kit, and the application is important for editing data
used in speech production.  The ported code is found in
/current/Applicatoins/Monet

./gnuspeech/trillium/src/softwareTRM - The tube model.  The ported
version can be found at ./current/Tools/softwareTRM

./gnuspeech/trillium/src/SpeechObject/postMonet/server.monet -
contains the server side of the TTS Kit, including a bunch of the
text-to-phone string goodies.

./gnuspeech/trillium/src/SpeechObject/Dictionary - contains the raw
pronunciation dictionaries used the the TTS Kit.

./gnuspeech/trillium/src/Synthesizer - An application for real-time
control of the synthesizer parameters.  Used to get parameters used by
vowels for Monet.

----------------------------------------

And now, here is the complete list:

./gnuspeech/MONET-manual
./gnuspeech/papers

./gnuspeech/trillium
./gnuspeech/trillium/Apps - contains several applications compiled for Nextstep.

./gnuspeech/trillium/Apps/HostToSoundout.app

./gnuspeech/trillium/Apps/SpeechRegistrar.app
./gnuspeech/trillium/Apps/TrilliumSoundEditor.app

./gnuspeech/trillium/bin - contains tools compiled for Nextstep, most
of which shouldn't be necessary any more.  The most interesting is
say, which allowed you to generate speech from the command line.

./gnuspeech/trillium/Dictionary - contains code to encrypt the
pronunciation dictionaries for the commercial version, since
considerable effort was invovled with creating them.  This is no
longer needed, and we can use the raw dictionary files as found in
/gnuspeech/trillium/src/SpeechObject/Dictionary/*MainDictionary.

./gnuspeech/trillium/ObjectiveC - Contains source to various tools and applications used during the development of the original TextToSpeech kit.
./gnuspeech/trillium/ObjectiveC/DEGAS - Source to Degas, the predecessor of Monet.

./gnuspeech/trillium/ObjectiveC/newServerTest
./gnuspeech/trillium/ObjectiveC/SpeechManager
./gnuspeech/trillium/ObjectiveC/SpeechRegistrar
./gnuspeech/trillium/ObjectiveC/TouchNTalk - an application to help visually disabled users.  It used a touch tablet.
./gnuspeech/trillium/ObjectiveC/TrilliumSoundEditor - A tool for visual signal analysis.  It's an enhanced version of FFTViewer.
./gnuspeech/trillium/ObjectiveC/TrilliumSoundView
./gnuspeech/trillium/ObjectiveC/TTS_Install - Installer for the Nextstep version of the TTS Kit.
./gnuspeech/trillium/ObjectiveC/TTS_Install_Demo - Installer for the demo of the Nextstep version of the TTS Kit.

./gnuspeech/trillium/priv/TTSEncrypt

./gnuspeech/trillium/src

./gnuspeech/trillium/src/AreaPalette - Contains the source code for
creating AreaPalette.palette, plus the associated installer package.
This is used by the Synthesizer to control the cross sectional area
for each section of the tube.

./gnuspeech/trillium/src/DEGAS-2.0 - Degas was the predecessor to Monet, used in the first version of the TextToSpeech Kit.
./gnuspeech/trillium/src/DriftGenerator - Test for the drift generator that is part of the tube model.

./gnuspeech/trillium/src/dspLod2Core - This program converts the DSP
code contained in the .lod file (output from the dsp assembler) to a
printable form in a header file suitable for inclusion by c programs.

./gnuspeech/trillium/src/ForbesPrEditor - Contains a compressed
archive of source code (and RCS files) of a modified PrEditor.
Changes were made by Michael Forbes to version 3.0.0.

./gnuspeech/trillium/src/PrEditor - PrEditor (from Pronunciation
Editor) is an application which helps you to create dictionaries of
custom pronunciations for use with the TextToSpeech Kit.

./gnuspeech/trillium/src/softwareTRM - The tube model.  The ported
version can be found at ./current/Tools/softwareTRM

./gnuspeech/trillium/src/SpeechObject

contains the server side of the TTS Kit, including a bunch of the
text-to-phone string goodies.
